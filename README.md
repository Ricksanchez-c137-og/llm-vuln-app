# HOSN-LLM-Challenge

This machine was designed to be vulnrable, do not use it in production environements. 

to start the machine you can pull the docker image from dockerhub or just build it locally using the commands below

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ricksanchez-c137-og/llm-vuln-app.git
```
then change directory to the folder of the repo

```bash
    sudo docker build -t hosn-llm . 
```

to pull the image you can easily do that using this command 

```bash 
    sudo docker pull vaxenee/hosn-llm:latest
```

then you can run  it normally using the comamnd below 

```bash 
sudo docker run -it -p 80:80 -p 8000:8000 -p 11434:11434 vaxenee/hosn-llm:latest
```

once the machine has started give it 5 mins to fully pull the AI models images and to set up everything. 

the UI of the the chat is very simple and straight forward.
